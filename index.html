	<h1> IYTP at UCLA </h1>

	<div class = "large-9 columns" id = "About"> 
		<h2> About </h2>
		<p> The Incarcerated Youth Tutorial Project (IYTP), founded in 1988, aims to help incarcerated youth at Camp Fred Miller in Malibu through one-on-one tutoring, personal development and mentoring. Join IYTP for one of our weekly site visits. Help interrupt the School-to-Prison Pipeline and learn the ways in which race often plays a central role in the juvenile justice system. Come join one of the only projects that work with incarcerated youth on campus and earn community service requirements at the same time. Email us at iytp.ucla@gmail.com or stop by our cubicle in the Student Activities Center (SAC) 106D. </p>

		<h3> Mission Statement </h3>
		<ul> 
			<li> To get all these students to grab a GED/High School Diploma and go to college.</li>
			<li> To remind state legislators of faults and issues within the juvenile incarceration system and engage the UCLA campus in political activities regarding juvenile justice. </li>
			<li> To make a lasting impact on and propose significant changes to Californiaâ€™s juvenile justice system. </li>
		</ul>
		<p> "Invest in education, not mass incarceration." </p>
